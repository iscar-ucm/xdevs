* xDEVS

** Introduction

xDEVS stands for /A cross-platform (x) Discrete EVent System simulator/. This library includes a set of C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python and Rust repositories that provide an event-driven simulation interface. This interface follows the formalism /Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS)/. The project final goal is to elaborate the fastest DEVS simulation interface with capacity to simulate models in virtual and real time, and to run simulations in sequential (single-threaded), parallel (multi-threaded) and distributed (not shared memory) architectures. 

Research in the xDEVS interface can be found in [[https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.3168][xDEVS: A toolkit for interoperable modeling and simulation of formal discrete event systems]]. Please, cite our article in case you find xDEVS useful. This way we can gain visibility:

There are seven repositories associated with xDEVS, each one offering the equivalent simulation interface for each corresponding programming language.

- xDEVS/C ([[https://github.com/iscar-ucm/xdevs.c][xdevs.c]])
- xDEVS/C++ ([[https://github.com/iscar-ucm/xdevs.cpp][xdevs.cpp]])
- xDEVS/C# ([[https://github.com/iscar-ucm/xdevs.cs][xdevs.cs]])
- xDEVS/Go ([[https://github.com/iscar-ucm/xdevs.go][xdevs.go]])
- xDEVS/Java ([[https://github.com/iscar-ucm/xdevs.java][xdevs.java]]) - [[https://iscar-ucm.github.io/xdevs.java][API documentation]]
- xDEVS/Python ([[https://github.com/iscar-ucm/xdevs.py][xdevs.py]])
- xDEVS/Rust ([[https://github.com/iscar-ucm/xdevs.rs][xdevs.rs]])

All the repositories are included as submodules inside this main repository.

The xDEVS user's manual can be found [[https://iscar-ucm.github.io/xdevs/][here]].

** Top features

- PDEVS Modeling and Simulation formalism
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Support for sequential, parallel and distributed (this last feature only in Java and Python, for now) architectures.
- Good performance, compared to other simulation engines

** Quick start

Switch to the corresponding particular language. A README file will be found to start with minimal examples and demos.
