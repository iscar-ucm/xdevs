xDEVS stands for <i>A cross-platform (x) Discrete EVent System simulator</i>. This library includes a set of C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python and Rust repositories that provide an event-driven simulation interface. This interface follows the formalism <i>Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS)</i>. The project final goal is to elaborate the fastest DEVS simulation interface with capacity to simulate models in virtual and real time, and to run simulations in sequential (single-threaded), parallel (multi-threaded) and distributed (not shared memory) architectures. 
</p>

<h2 id="orga7b7d1f">The DEVS formalism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga7b7d1f">
<p>
The Discrete EVent system Specification (DEVS) formalism [1] was first introduced by Zeigler in 1976, to provide a rigorous common basis for discrete-event modeling and simulation. A "common" basis means that it is possible to express popular discrete-event formalisms such as event-scheduling, activity-scanning and process-interaction using the DEVS formalism.
</p>

<p>
The class of formalisms denoted as discrete-event is characterized by a continuous time base where only a finite number of events can occur during a finite time-span. This contrasts with Discrete Time System Specification (DTSS) formalisms where the time base is isomorphic to N, and with Differential Equation System Specification (DESS, or continuous-time) formalisms in which the state of the system may change continuously over time.
</p>

<p>
The Formalism Transformation Graph (FTG) published by H. Vangheluwe in [3] and shown in Figure 1, depicts behavior-conserving transformations between some important formalisms. The graph distinguishes between continuous-time formalisms on the left-hand side, and discrete formalisms (both discrete-time and discrete-event) on the right-hand side. Although the graph suggests that formalisms can be mapped onto a common formalism on their respective sides, very few transformations allow crossing the middle-line: this illustrates why hybrid systems (those that bring together both discrete and continuous systems) are difficult to solve.
</p>

<p>

Figure 1. Formalism transformation graph (FTG) [3].
</p>

<p>
The traditional approach to solve continuous-time problems is based on discretization, which approximates a continuous-time model by a discrete-time system (difference equations). A partitioning of the time-axis, as is the case in discretization, is however hard to harmonize with a partitioning of the state space, as is performed in discrete-event systems. In this regard, mapping continuous-time formalisms (ODEs and semi-explicit DAEs) onto the DEVS formalism (this corresponds to the arrow going from "scheduling-hybrid-DAE" to "DEVS" on the FTG) may be performed through quantization. 
</p>

<p>
The closure property (under composition or coupling) of systems such as DEVS offers the possibility to describe a model as a hierarchical composition of simpler sub-components. Apart from the obvious advantages associated with modularity (conceptual level, component reusability), a significant gain in the efficiency of simulating large, complex dynamic systems can also be achieved by using multi-rate integration (employing different integration frame rates for the simulation of fast and slow sub-components), either on a single or on multiple processors (parallelization).
</p>

<p>
Although some continuous-time formalisms (e.g., causal-block diagram simulation tools) allow model hierarchization, multi-rate integration mixes poorly with traditional approaches where discretization along the time-axis forces the simulator to work explicitly with the global time base. This, in contrast to discrete-event formalisms where the simulator is concerned with local state space changes, and the time base is dealt with implicitly. Discrete event concepts are thus better suited for parallel distributed simulation, and much effort has been devoted to the development of conservative (e.g., Chandy-Misra approach), optimistic (e.g., Time-Warp) and real-time (e.g., DARPA's Distributed Interactive Simulation) parallel discrete event simulation techniques. The relevance of DEVS in that context is illustrated by the concept of the DEVS bus which concerns the use of DEVS models as "wrappers" to enable a variety of models to inter operate in a networked simulation. The DEVS bus has been implemented on top of the DoD's High Level Architecture (HLA) standard, itself based on the Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI) protocol.
</p>

<p>
According to DEVS theory, the system of interest is seen as a model and the corresponding simulator. The model represents a simplified version of reality and its structure. The model is built considering the conditions of experimentation of the system of interest, including the work conditions of the real system and its application domain. Thus, the model is restricted to the experimental framework under which it was developed.
</p>

<p>
This model is subsequently used to build a simulator. The simulator is able to change the state of the model by running all the necessary state transitions already defined in the model. All the transitions are executed in an appropriate order, according to the model definition.
</p>

<p>
DEVS was created for modeling and simulation of discrete-event dynamic systems. As a result, it defines a formal way to define systems whose states change either upon the reception of an input event or due to the expiration of a time delay. In order to deal with the system under study, the model can be organized hierarchically in such a way that higher-level components in a system are decomposed into simpler elements. 
</p>

<p>
The formal separation between model and simulator and the hierarchical and modular nature of the DEVS formalism have enabled carrying out of formal proofs on the different entities under study. One of them is the proof of composability of the subcomponents (including legitimacy and equivalence between multicomponent models). The second is the ability to conduct proofs of correctness of the simulation algorithms, which result in simulators rigorously verified. All the proofs are based on formal transformations between each of the representations, trying to prove the equivalence between the entities under study at different levels of abstraction. For instance, we can prove that the mathematical entity simulator is able to execute correctly the behavior described by the mathematical entity model, which represents the system.
Different mathematical mechanisms are used to prove these points, including the mathematical manipulation of the abstraction hierarchy, observation of I/O trajectories (to ensure that different levels of specification correctly describe the system’ structure) and decomposition concepts (DEVS is closed under composition, which means that a composite model integrated by multiple components is equivalent to an atomic component).
</p>

<p>
The reader should refer to the book Theory of Modeling and Simulation [1], to understand the details behind the mathematical background of these techniques.

<h4 id="org5c5c1c6">The parallel DEVS formalism</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5c5c1c6">
<p>
The parallel DEVS approach was introduced, after 15 years, as a revision of Classic DEVS. Currently, parallel DEVS is the prevalent DEVS, implemented in many libraries. In the following, unless it is explicitly noted, the use of DEVS implies parallel DEVS.
</p>

<p>
DEVS enables the representation of a system by three sets and five functions: input set (X), output set (Y), state set (S), external transition function (&delta;<sub>ext</sub>), internal transition function (&delta;<sub>int</sub>), confluent function (&delta;<sub>con</sub>), output function (&lambda;), and time advance function (ta). 
</p>

<p>
DEVS models are of two types: atomic and coupled. Atomic DEVS processes input events based on their model's current state and condition, generates output events and transition to the next state. The coupled model is the aggregation/composition of two or more atomic and coupled models connected by explicit couplings. Particularly, an atomic model is defined by the following equation:
</p>

<p>
A=&lt; <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>S</b>, &delta;<sub>ext</sub>,  &delta;<sub>int</sub>, &delta;<sub>con</sub>, &lambda;, ta &gt;
</p>

<p>
where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>X</b> is the input set, usually defined as the set of pairs port-value (see DEVS with ports in [1]).</li>
<li><b>Y</b> is the output set, usually defined as the set of pairs port-value (see DEVS with ports in [1])..</li>
<li><b>S</b> is the state set.</li>
<li>&delta;<sub>ext</sub> : <b>Q</b> &times; <b>X<sup>b</sup></b> &rarr; <b>S</b> is the external transition function, Q={(s,e):s &isin; S, e &isin; [0,ta(s)]} is total state set and e is the elapsed time since the last transition, whereas X<sup>b</sup> is the set of bags over elements in X. This function is automatically executed when an external event arrives, changing the current state if needed.</li>
<li>&delta;<sub>int</sub> : S &rarr; S is the internal transition function. This function is executed right after the output (&lambda;) function and is used to change the state S.</li>
<li>&delta;<sub>con</sub>: Q &times; X<sup>b</sup> &rarr; S is the confluent function. This transition decides the next state in cases of collision between external and internal events, i.e., an external event is received and elapsed time equals time-advance. Typically, &delta;<sub>con</sub>(s,ta(s),x) = &delta;<sub>ext</sub>(&delta;<sub>int</sub>(s,0,x).</li>
<li>&lambda; : S &rarr; Y<sup>b</sup> is the output function. Y<sup>b</sup> is the set of bags over elements in Y. When the time elapsed since the last output function is equal to ta(s), then &lambda; is automatically executed.</li>
<li>ta : S &rarr; R<sub>0</sub><sup>+</sup> &cup; &infin; is the time advance function.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The formal definition of a coupled model is described as:
</p>

<p>
M = &lt; <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>EIC</b>, <b>EOC</b>, <b>IC</b> &gt;
</p>

<p>
where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>X</b> is the input set, usually defined as the set of pairs port-value (see DEVS with ports in [1])..</li>
<li><b>Y</b> is the output set, usually defined as the set of pairs port-value (see DEVS with ports in [1])..</li>
<li><b>C</b> is the set of DEVS component models (atomic or coupled). Note that <b>C</b> makes this definition recursive.</li>
<li><b>EIC</b> is the external input coupling relation, from external input ports of M to component input ports of <b>C</b>.</li>
<li><b>EOC</b> is the external output coupling relation, from component output ports of <b>C</b> to external output ports of M.</li>
<li><b>IC</b> is the internal coupling relation, from component output ports of c<sub>i</sub> &isin; <b>C</b> to component output ports of c<sub>j</sub> &isin; <b>C</b>, provided that i &ne; j.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given the recursive definition of <b>M</b>, a coupled model can itself be a part of a component in a larger coupled model system giving rise to a hierarchical DEVS model construction.

A processor atomic model consumes a job j. When the processor receives a job through an input port, thus the processor remains busy until the processing time j<sub>p</sub> is finished. Then it sends the job through an output port.

<p>
The Experimental frame – Processor model is usually presented as one of the initial examples to start to practice with DEVS modeling and simulation. It is a DEVS coupled model consisting of three atomic models and one coupled model (see Figure 3).
</p>

<p>
<img src="./fig/efp.png" alt="efp.png" />
Figure 3. Experimental frame (ef)-processor (p) model; boxes: models; arrows: couplings; arrow labels: input/output port names.
</p>

<p>
The Generator atomic model generates job-messages at fixed time intervals and sends them via the "out" port. The Transducer atomic model accepts job-messages from the generator at its "arrived" port and remembers their arrival time instances. It also accepts job-messages at the "solved" port. When a message arrives at the "solved" port, the transducer matches this job with the previous job that had arrived on the "arrived" port earlier and calculates their time difference. Together, these two atomic models form an Experimental frame coupled model. The experimental frame sends the generators job messages on the "out" port and forwards the messages received on its "in" port to the transducers "solved" port. The transducer observes the response (in this case the turnaround time) of messages that are injected into an observed system. The observed system in this case is the Processor atomic model. A processor accepts jobs at its "in" port and sends them via "out" port again after some finite, but non-zero time period. If the processor is busy when a new job arrives, the processor discards it. Finally the transducer stops the generation of jobs by sending any event from its "out" port to the "stop" port at the generator, after a given simulation time interval.
</p>

<p>
Based on Figure 3, we can define the coupled model for this example as:
</p>

<p>
EFP=〈 <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>EIC</b>, <b>EOC</b>, <b>IC</b> 〉
</p>

<p>
where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>X</b> = ∅.</li>
<li><b>Y</b> = ∅.</li>
<li><b>C</b> = {EF,P}</li>
<li><b>EIC</b> = ∅</li>
<li><b>EOC</b> = ∅</li>
<li><b>IC</b> = {(EF,out)→(P,in),(P,out)→(EF,in)}</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Experimental Frame coupled model can be defined as:
</p>

<p>
EF=〈 <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>EIC</b>, <b>EOC</b>, <b>IC</b> 〉
</p>

<p>
where:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>X</b> = {(in,j∈J)}, where J is a set of Jobs.</li>
<li><b>Y</b> = {(out,j∈J)}, where J is a set of Jobs.</li>
<li><b>C</b> = {G,T}</li>
<li><b>EIC</b> = {(EF,in)→(T,solved)}</li>
<li><b>EOC</b> = {(G,out)→(EF,out)}</li>
<li><b>IC</b> = {(G,out)→(T,arrived),(T,out)→(Generator,stop)}</li>
</ul>

<p>
We have defined the behavior of the Processor model in a previous example. Now, we describe the functionality of both the Generator and Transduced models. The Generator model can be formally described as
</p>

<p>
Generator=〈 <b>X</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>Y</b>, δ<sub>int</sub>, δ<sub>ext</sub>, δ<sub>con</sub>, λ, ta 〉
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>X</b> = {(stop,ν)}, where ν is any event</li>
<li><b>S</b> = (phase={"active","passive"})×σ∈R0+×i=1,2,…,N:ji∈J</li>
<li><b>Y</b> = {(out,ji∈ J)}</li>
<li>ta(phase,σ,i) = σ</li>
<li>λ(phase,σ,i) = ji</li>
<li>δ<sub>int</sub>(phase,σ,i) = ("active",σ,i+1)</li>
<li>δ<sub>ext</sub>(phase,σ,i,e,(in,ν)) = ("passive",∞,i)</li>
<li>δ<sub>con</sub>(phase,σ,i,(in,ν)) = δ<sub>ext</sub>(δ<sub>int</sub>(phase,σ,i),0,(in,ν))</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Transducer model can be formally described as
</p>

<p>
Transducer=〈 <b>X</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>Y</b>, δ<sub>int</sub>, δ<sub>ext</sub>, δ<sub>con</sub>, λ, ta 〉
</p>

In this section, we introduce the basics of xDEVS by developing a simple Ping Pong model. This model is inspired by the DEVS formalism as described on Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEVS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEVS</a>

<p>
The Ping Pong model simulates two players hitting a ball back and forth. We will define the model's behavior using output, internal transition, and external transition functions.

<p>
In xDEVS, atomic models are the fundamental building blocks for constructing simulation models. An atomic model in xDEVS encapsulates the behavior of a system component that cannot be further decomposed into smaller components. It defines the state changes and interactions of the component in response to internal and external events.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org85dba18" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org85dba18">Structure of an atomic model</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org85dba18">
<p>
The <code>Atomic</code> class, derived from the <code>Component</code> class and marked as an abstract base class, serves as the base class for all atomic models in xDEVS. Here's a breakdown of its key components and functionalities:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Initialization</b>: The constructor initializes the atomic model, setting its name and initializing its phase to <code>passive</code> and its time advance (<code>sigma</code>) to infinity. This represents a state where the model is waiting indefinitely for an external event.</li>

<li><b>Time Advance Function (<code>ta</code>)</b>: This property method returns the time until the next scheduled internal transition (<code>sigma</code>). It dictates how long the model stays in its current state before an internal transition occurs.</li>

<li><b>Internal Transition (<code>deltint</code>)</b>: This abstract method must be implemented by all subclasses. It defines the state changes that occur when an internal event is triggered after the elapse of the time advance.</li>

<li><b>External Transition (<code>deltext</code>)</b>: This abstract method handles state changes in response to external events. It takes the elapsed time (<code>e</code>) since the last transition as an argument, allowing the model to update its state based on external inputs.</li>

<li><b>Output Function (<code>lambdaf</code>)</b>: Another abstract method that specifies the output of the model just before an internal transition occurs. This function is crucial for sending outputs to other models in a coupled model configuration.</li>

<li><b>Confluent Transition (<code>deltcon</code>)</b>: By default, this method handles the simultaneous occurrence of internal and external events. It first processes the internal transition and then the external transition with zero elapsed time.</li>

<li><b>State Management Methods</b>: The methods <code>hold_in</code>, <code>activate</code>, <code>passivate</code>, and <code>continuef</code> are utility functions to manage the model's state and timing:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>hold_in</code>: Sets the model's phase and schedules the next internal transition.</li>
<li><code>activate</code>: Immediately triggers an internal transition by setting <code>sigma</code> to zero.</li>
<li><code>passivate</code>: Puts the model into a passive state with an infinite wait time.</li>
<li><code>continuef</code>: Adjusts the time advance by reducing it by the elapsed time <code>e</code>, useful for resuming after a paused state.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="org30fda5d">Implementing an atomic model</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org30fda5d">
<p>
To implement an atomic model in xDEVS, you need to subclass the <code>Atomic</code> class and provide concrete implementations for the <code>deltint</code>, <code>deltext</code>, and <code>lambdaf</code> methods. Each method should define how the model reacts to different types of events and manages its state transitions effectively.

<h4 id="org9c1d193">Ports</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9c1d193">
<p>
In xDEVS, ports are essential for enabling communication between atomic models and facilitating the flow of events in a coupled model configuration. Ports are used to send and receive messages, allowing models to interact with each other.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Input Ports</i>: These ports receive messages from other models. Each input port is associated with a specific type of message it can accept. When an external event occurs, the message is placed in the corresponding input port, and the <code>deltext</code> method is invoked to handle the event.</li>

<li><i>Output Ports</i>: These ports send messages to other models. Before an internal transition occurs, the <code>lambdaf</code> method generates the output, which is then placed in the appropriate output port. The coupled model configuration ensures that these messages are routed to the correct input ports of other models.</li>

To define ports in an atomic model, you need to create instances of the <code>Port</code> class and add them to the model using the <code>add_in_port</code> and <code>add_out_port</code> methods. Here is an example demonstrating the use of ports in atomic models:

<p>
In this example, the <code>Generator</code> model has input ports <code>i_start</code> and <code>i_stop</code> and an output port <code>o_out</code>. The <code>Processor</code> model has an input port <code>i_in</code> and an output port <code>o_out</code>. These ports facilitate the communication between the <code>Generator</code> and <code>Processor</code> models, allowing them to exchange <code>Job</code> messages.
</p>

<p>
By defining and using ports, you can create complex coupled models where multiple atomic models interact seamlessly, enabling sophisticated simulations of system behaviors.

<p>
In xDEVS, coupled models are composite models that consist of multiple atomic and/or other coupled models. They define the structure and interaction of these submodels, enabling the construction of complex systems by combining simpler components. Coupled models manage the routing of messages between their submodels and handle the overall coordination of events.

<h4 id="orgc7577cb">Structure of a coupled model</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc7577cb">
<p>
The <code>Coupled</code> class, derived from the <code>Component</code> class, serves as the base class for all coupled models in xDEVS. Here are the key components and functionalities of a coupled model:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Submodels</i>: A coupled model contains a collection of submodels, which can be either atomic models or other coupled models. These submodels are added to the coupled model using the <code>add_component</code> method.</li>

<li><i>Ports</i>: Similar to atomic models, coupled models have input and output ports. These ports are used to receive external messages and send messages to other models outside the coupled model.</li>

<li><i>Couplings</i>: Couplings define the connections between the ports of submodels and the ports of the coupled model. There are three types of couplings:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Internal Couplings</i>: Connect the output ports of one submodel to the input ports of another submodel within the same coupled model.</li>
<li>/External Input Couplings (EIC)*: Connect the input ports of the coupled model to the input ports of its submodels.</li>
<li>/External Output Couplings (EOC)*: Connect the output ports of the submodels to the output ports of the coupled model.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><i>Routing</i>: The coupled model is responsible for routing messages according to the defined couplings. When a message arrives at an input port, it is routed to the appropriate submodel(s) based on the EIC. Similarly, when a submodel generates an output, it is routed to other submodels or the coupled model's output ports based on the internal couplings and EOC.</li>
</ul>

To implement a coupled model in xDEVS, you need to subclass the <code>Coupled</code> class and define its submodels and couplings. Here is an example of a simple coupled model that combines a <code>Generator</code> and a <code>Processor</code>:

<p>
In this example, the <code>BasicCoupledModel</code> class defines a coupled model that includes a <code>Generator</code> and a <code>Processor</code> as submodels. The couplings are set up to route messages from the generator to the processor and from the processor to the coupled model's output port. Additionally, an external input coupling is defined to allow external messages to stop the generator.
</p>

<p>
By defining submodels and their couplings, you can create complex systems that simulate the interactions and behaviors of multiple components working together. Coupled models provide a powerful way to build hierarchical and modular simulations in xDEVS.

<h3 id="org6c46c22">Wrappers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6c46c22">
<p>
Adding compatibility between different DEVS simulation engines, and more specifically, between DEVS models developed in the same programming language, is the first step to designing a DEVS M&amp;S interoperable framework. Thus, xDEVS incorporates adapters to interact with other simulation engines.
</p>

<p>
xDEVS includes wrappers for aDEVS 3.3 (in xDEVS/C++), DEVSJAVA 3 (in xDEVS/Java), and PyPDEVS 2.4.1 (in xDEVS/Python). The design of the other adapters follows the same pattern. Adding more wrappers is a straightforward process. The target model is added as an attribute, and each DEVS function elaborates a simple conversion. Using these adapters, xDEVS models can be easily combined with external DEVS libraries, especially in C++, Java, and Python.
</p>

<p>
Another important wrapper is <code>Coupled2Atomic</code>, which represents an abstraction of a coupled model with an atomic model. Due to the closure under coupling property of the DEVS formalism (borrowed from Systems theoretical closure under composition principle), we have an abstraction mechanism by which a coupled model can be executed like an atomic model. In traditional DEVS hierarchical modeling, a coupled model is merely a container and has corresponding coupled-simulators. Using the closure under coupling property, it can be transformed into an atomic model with the lowest level atomic simulator. This has been accomplished by implementing this adapter. The <code>Coupled2Atomic</code> wrapper takes special relevance in distributed simulations: when a model is split, and each part is simulated in different machines, a whole part can be a coupled model. Without this wrapper, partitioning a hierarchical model for distributed deployment is a challenge. This wrapper allows simulating the whole coupled model hierarchy as a single atomic model deployed on a specific machine.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Finally, the mechanism of building wrappers is also a powerful tool to provide interoperability between DEVS and non-DEVS models. We do not address this issue formally because there is no standard mechanism to communicate a DEVS wrapper with a non-DEVS model. The structure of the wrapper completely depends on the implementation of the non-DEVS model.
</p>

Below is the implementation of the <code>Coupled2Atomic</code> class in Java:

<h3 id="org8a8b2d9">Models Flattening</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8a8b2d9">
<p>
Model flattening is often used to simplify models for simulation efficiency and reduce the overheads introduced by message passing between coordinators in complex models with deep hierarchies. This technique takes advantage of the closure under coupling property to generate an equivalent single-level model from the original model. Hence, the intermediate coupled models are eliminated, and the message passing happens directly between all the atomic models. This algorithm has been incorporated in all the xDEVS branches, allowing this transformation when specifying the simulation root coordinator.
</p>

<p>
The following Java code demonstrates how to perform a flattened simulation of the EFP model using the xDEVS framework:

<p>
The <code>Coordinator</code> includes a constructor that accepts a boolean parameter <code>flatten</code>. If <code>flatten</code> is set to <code>true</code>, the model is flattened before the simulation begins. The <code>Efp</code> class defines a coupled model with components <code>Ef</code> and <code>Processor</code>, and their respective couplings.
</p>

<p>
To perform a flattened simulation of the EFP model, create the coordinator as follows:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-java"><span style="color: #98f5ff;">Coordinator</span> <span style="color: #4eee94;">coordinator</span> = <span style="color: #00bfff;">new</span> <span style="color: #98f5ff;">Coordinator</span>(efp, <span style="color: #a2cd5a;">true</span>);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This will ensure that the model is flattened, eliminating intermediate coupled models and allowing direct message passing between all atomic models, thus improving simulation efficiency.

<h3 id="orgea8e54f">Parallel simulation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgea8e54f">
<p>
Parallel simulation in xDEVS allows you to run simulations using multiple threads, which can significantly speed up the process, especially for complex models. This is particularly useful when your model has many components that can be computed independently.
</p>

<p>
Here's how you can use the parallel simulation feature:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Setup the Model</b>: First, define your model as usual. Let's say you have a model named <code>Gpt</code> that you want to simulate.</li>

<li><b>Choose the Coordinator</b>: For parallel simulation, use the <code>CoordinatorParallel</code> class. This coordinator can automatically distribute the simulation tasks across multiple threads.</li>

<li><b>Initialization</b>: Initialize the coordinator with your model. You can specify the number of threads, or let the system decide based on the available processors.</li>

<li><b>Run the Simulation</b>: Start the simulation. The coordinator manages how tasks are distributed and executed in parallel, ensuring that all parts of the model are synchronized correctly.</li>

<li><b>Completion</b>: Once the simulation is complete, you can shut down the coordinator and handle the results.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here is a simple example of how to set up and run a parallel simulation:

<p>
In this setup, the <code>CoordinatorParallel</code> handles the distribution of tasks across threads, making the simulation run faster than a sequential approach, especially for large models. This method is effective for reducing simulation time and is ideal for performance-critical simulations.

Distributed simulation involves splitting the simulation tasks across different machines or processes. Each machine or process runs a part of the model, and they communicate with each other to synchronize the simulation. This setup can be complex, requiring the deployment of virtual machines, containers, or other distributed infrastructures. However, for testing purposes, you can run a distributed simulation on a single computer by using multiple terminals.

<p>
Real-time simulation in xDEVS allows you to run simulations that synchronize with real-world time, making it possible to interact with the simulation in real-time or to integrate it with real-time systems. This feature is particularly useful for applications such as hardware-in-the-loop testing, real-time control systems, and interactive simulations.
</p>

<p>
The real-time simulation in xDEVS is managed by the <code>RTCentralCoordinator</code> class, which extends the capabilities of the <code>CoordinatorParallel</code> to support real-time execution. The <code>RTCentralCoordinator</code> ensures that the simulation clock progresses in sync with the real-world clock, scaled by a user-defined factor.

<li><b>Real-time Synchronization</b>: The coordinator ensures that the simulation events are processed in real-time, maintaining synchronization with the real-world clock.</li>

<li><b>Parallel Execution</b>: Leveraging the <code>CoordinatorParallel</code>, the real-time coordinator can distribute simulation tasks across multiple threads, enhancing performance.</li>

Real-time simulation in xDEVS provides a powerful tool for applications requiring synchronization with real-world time. By using the <code>RTCentralCoordinator</code>, you can control the speed of your simulation, interact with it in real-time, and leverage parallel execution for enhanced performance. This feature is essential for developing and testing real-time systems and interactive applications.

<p>
Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation is a powerful technique that integrates real hardware components into a simulation environment. This allows for testing and validation of systems in a more realistic setting, where the hardware interacts with the simulated environment in real-time. The xDEVS framework supports HIL simulation by providing real-time simulation capabilities and flexible communication interfaces.

<p>
In this example, we will simulate a queueing system, such as a bank or a customer service center, using the xDEVS/Python API. The system will consist of a generator that produces customers, a queue where customers wait, and a server that processes the customers.
</p>

<p>
The goal is to model the arrival, waiting, and service processes. We will create atomic models for the generator, queue, and server. The generator will produce customers at a specified rate. The queue will manage the waiting customers. Unlike a simple "push" system, the Server will actively "pull" customers from the Queue by sending a request message when it becomes idle. This ensures the server only receives a customer when it is ready, preventing customer loss.

<li><b><code>Queue</code></b>:: This model acts as a buffer. It uses a "pull-based" mechanism.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It receives customers from the <code>Generator</code> and adds them to an internal list (<code>self.queue</code>).</li>
<li>It <b>also</b> receives requests from the <code>Server</code> on its <code>input_request</code> port.</li>
<li>Only when it has <b>both</b> a pending request from the server (<code>self.customer_requested</code> is True) <b>and</b> at least one customer in its queue, it schedules an event to send the next customer. A small delay of 0.1 time units is used to simulate moving the customer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b><code>Server</code></b>:: This model processes customers.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When it is idle, it sends a request (<code>True</code>) on its <code>output_request</code> port to the <code>Queue</code>.</li>
<li>When it receives a customer from the <code>Queue</code>, it enters a "busy" state and holds for the <code>service_time</code>. In this simulation, this time is fixed at <b>5.0 time units</b>.</li>
<li>After the service is complete, it logs the completion and immediately schedules another event to request a new customer.</li>

In this section, we will demonstrate how to run a parallel simulation using the DEVS/Java API. We will use the Experimental Frame - Processor (EFP) model as an example. The EFP model consists of a generator, a processor, and a transducer. The generator produces jobs, the processor processes them, and the transducer collects statistics.
